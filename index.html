            <p>Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among
                programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data
                integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows (thousands of parallel branches running on different
                systems).
                Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel, with other kernel developers contributing
                to its initial development. Since 2005, Junio Hamano has been the core maintainer. As with most other distributed
                version control systems, and unlike most clientâ€“server systems, every Git directory on every computer is a full-fledged
                repository with complete history and full version-tracking abilities, independent of network access or a central
                server. Git is free and open-source software distributed under GNU General Public License Version 2.
